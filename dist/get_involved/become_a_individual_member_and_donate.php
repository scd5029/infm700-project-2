             "Growing up in Baltimore, Patterson Park was an important place for myself, my friends, and my family. During the day, Patterson Park was our playground. We climbed trees, sat on cannon (fighting the War of 1812 over, again and again), sailed our small sailboats on the boat lake, ran up and down hills with seagulls flying overhead - enjoying our youth, our freedom and our young mothers who were usually with us. I became a member to make sure this park can live on and help create lasting childhood memories in the years to come." - Bill Mules

              Naming the Friends of Patterson Park in your Will gives you the opportunity to leave a lasting legacy in Patterson Park, and possibly provide your family with tax benefits after your death.
            </p>
            <p>
              People of all ages and walks of life chose to name their favorite charities in their Last Will and Testaments, or as a beneficiary of an insurance policy or investment account. The Friends suggests you consult with your professional advisors when making such important decisions about your estate plans. If you chose to include the Friends in your Will, here is the language we suggest using:
            </p>
            <p>
              "I devise to the Friends of Patterson Park, a nonprofit corporation of the state of Maryland located at 27 S. Patterson Park Avenue, Baltimore, 21231, ___% / the sum of $____ to benefit the Friends of Patterson Park."
            </p>
            <p>
              Please let us know if you've named us in your Will! The Friends plans to start a Legacy Society in the near future to honor and recognize our planned giving supporters.
