          <h2>How Is My Gift Used?</h2>
          <p>
            Over 93% of the Friends annual operating budget comes from you - our generous individual and business members, and foundation supporters. With your continued commitment to our mission, the Friends staff and our 600+ volunteers will keep Patterson Park beautiful and safe, provide recreational programs for area youth and families, host community arts and cultural events, and work with Baltimore City on capital improvements and issues important to keeping Patterson Park "Baltimore's Best Backyard."
          </p>

              <p>
                In 2012 our volunteers planted 66 new trees, mulched and watered 392 trees, removed 50 bags of trash from around the Boat Lake, and tended 10 garden beds and 15 plant urns! They also kept the Marble Fountain clean, and staffed Pagoda Sundays. More than 1,600 visitors came to the Pagoda from just August through October after its exterior repairs were completed (see below)

              <p>
                More than 320 youth participated in the Friends soccer program, 60 joined our tennis clinics, and 300 took Zumba classes. In 2012 our soccer participants also got a chance to play with other kids from Soccer Without Borders, creating new friendships and building soccer skills together. The Friends also facilitated Rec Center programs like youth soccer, bi-lingual knitting classes, and Bienestar intercultural cooking classes.

              <p>
                The first 2012 summer concert broke all attendance records with approximately 2,200 adults and kids enjoying music on Pagoda Hill. An estimated 1,000 children and adults came to our second annual Dia del Nino (Kids' Day) event, and 6,000 people attended the Halloween Lantern Parade. The Friends also produced the Volunteer Party, Wine Tasting at Sunset, Boat Lake Breakfast, Moonlight Pagoda, Fishing Festival, Spring Egg Hunt, Kinetic Sculpture Race Pagoda Stop, and more!

              <h3>Park Stewardship Teams</h3>
              <p>
                In 2013 we'll plant at least 70 trees and mulch all of the small trees in the park, as we work with the Parks & People Foundation to host War of 1812 Commemorative Tree Planting programs in the park. The Boat Lake Team will be getting new nets for cleaning the lake, and the Friends staff will be working with BCRP on addressing the algae issue in the Boat Lake. The Pagoda Team will host a Pagoda Opening Day and keep the Pagoda open, clean and surrounded by beautiful gardens for the rest of the season. We'll continue to hold our Weedin' Wednesday volunteer days starting in April, to plant and weed the beautiful garden beds at the Pagoda, Marble Fountain, and White House (Friends offices).

              <p>
                Whew! The Friends 2013 calendar is already jam-packed with the annual community and membership events you all know and love - Volunteer Party, Community Egg Hunt, Dia del Nino, Wine Tasting at Sunset, Fishing Festival, Summer Concert Series, Boat Lake Breakfast, Corporate Friends Reception, Moonlight Pagoda, Halloween Lantern Parade, and much more. We'll also be preparing for the City's big War of 1812 celebration in 2014 - the "Star Spangled Spectacular" - during which exciting events are already being planned for Patterson Park, as it played a critical role in the land invasion of the Battle of Baltimore. Check our e-newsletter and website frequently, and also stay tuned for an announcement about an exciting new festival coming to Patterson Park this fall!

                Be on the lookout for announcements for five soccer sessions, two tennis clinics, Zumba classes, Salsa lessons (new in 2013), a newly formed Walking Group co-hosted by Southeast CDC, more simultaneous programming for youth and adults, and the return of movies in the park! Friends staff and our Consejo Hispano will also be exploring ideas for new and expanded intercultural and language exchange programs in the park and the Virginia S. Baker Recreation Center.

              <p>
                So many of you turned out for the Friends Happy Hour in November that we've decided to host them quarterly in 2013! We'll be rotating locations, supporting bars and restaurants close to the park. We'll also be growing our Ambassador and Corporate Friends programs, so we'll be looking for new volunteers to staff event tables and recruit new members for the Friends, and we'll be talking to area businesses about getting more involved in the park.
